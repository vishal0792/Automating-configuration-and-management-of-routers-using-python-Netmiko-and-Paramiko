## Automating configuration and management of routers using python Netmiko and Paramiko

1. Programmed a python code to fetch router interface and version details using Netmiko
2. Programmed a python code to configure ospf on routers by pushing the configuration from a text file using Netmiko
3. Programmed a python code to configure ospf and interface ip address by pushing the configuration from a text file using Netmiko
4. Programmed a python code to verify the down interfaces in routers and then configure to make two random interfaces noshut and print all the interface in a text file interface.txt. Also, fetch the ecmp routes from the router and performed this action using multithreading, to connect the routers simultaneously.
